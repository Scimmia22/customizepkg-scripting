Customizepkg-scripting: A straight forward approach to modifying PKGBUILDs

The popular pacman wrapper yaourt is set up to run the original customizepkg
whenever it rebuilds a package. This provides a structured command format that,
while simple, is very limiting. This version uses the same command line
parameters, making it fully compatable with yaourt or other programs that may
call it, but lets the user script whatever they want to do in modifying the
PKGBUILD, making it far more flexable. Instructions are provided in the
etc/customize.d directory.
