# This version of customizepkg simply calls script files in this directory that
# have a file name matching the pkgname of the PKGBUILD being used.
#
# You can script whatever you want done to the PKGBUILD or install file with
# very little restriction. sed, patch, whatever you want to do.
#
# Make sure you set the scripts as world executable (chmod +x <filename>)
#
# $1=PKGBUILD file to be modified
# $2=install script to be modified
